## Why Go?

>**Go** is becoming increasingly popular in the tech industry, and many companies are adopting it for system-level and cloud-native applications. I had initially considered  **Rust**, as I used it extensively during my compiler construction course, but it felt lower-level and less relevant for most DevOps tools and workflows.

I chose **Go** for the following reasons:

1. **DevOps Industry Standard** — Most DevOps tools are written in Go (Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Prometheus)
2. **Simple Syntax** — Easy to learn coming from Python
3. **Single Binary** — Compiles to one file with zero dependencies
4. **Fast Performance** — Native compiled code
